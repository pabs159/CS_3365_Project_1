# CS_3365_Project_1
Group collaborated project for CS 3365 at TTU. Implementing a Java written program with eventual GUI implementation. (This one being a weather API call)

The program can be broken down into two parts. The weather API call (Thanks to the individuals at DarkSky), and the GUI. Arguments from the call are then to be sanatized and then eventually passed into the GUI and displayed.  

**NOTE That you must add the jar folder and or just the JSON jar file to your CLASSPATH**
